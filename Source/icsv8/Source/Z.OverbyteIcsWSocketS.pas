History:
Sep 05, 1999 V1.01 Adpted for Delphi 1
Oct 09, 1999 V1.02 Added intermediate class TCustomWSocket
Nov 12, 1999 V1.03 Added OnClientCreate event just after client component has
                   been created.
Apr 02, 2000 V1.04 Added FSessionClosedFlag to avoid double SessionClosed
                   event triggering
Apr 13, 2002 V1.05 When sending banner to client, add LineEnd instead of CR/LF
                   as suggested by David Aguirre Grazio <djagra@xaire.com>
Sep 13, 2002 V1.06 Check if Assigned(Server) in TriggerSessionClosed.
                   Reported by Matthew Meadows <matthew.meadows@inquisite.com>
Sep 16, 2002 V1.07 Fixed a Delphi 1 issue in TriggerSessionClosed where
                   property was used in place of field variable.
Jan 04, 2003 V1.08 Renamed BannerToBusy to BannerTooBusy. This will cause
                   trouble in applications already using this property. You
                   have to rename the property in your app !
Jan 24, 2003 V5.00 Skipped to version 5 because of SSL code
Jan 26, 2004 V5.01 Introduced ICSDEFS.INC and reordered uses for FPC
                   compatibility.
May 01, 2004 V5.02 WMClientClosed was incorrectly referencing global Error
                   variable instead of the real winsock error code. Now pass
                   the errcode in WParam at the time of PostMessage.
                   Removed Forms and Graphics units from the uses clause.
May 23, 2005 V5.03 Added intermediate variable NewHSocket in procedure
                   TriggerSessionAvailable
Dec 30, 2005 V6.00b A.Garrels added IcsLogger
Jan 06, 2008 V6.01 Angus added Disconnect(Client) and DisconnectAll
May 01, 2008 V6.02 A. Garrels - Function names adjusted according to changes in
                   OverbyteIcsLibrary.pas.
May 14, 2008 V6.03 A. Garrels - Type change from String to AnsiString in
                   TWSocketClient (FPeerPort and FPeerAddr).
Aug 11, 2008 V6.04 A. Garrels - Type AnsiString rolled back String.
Nov 6,  2008 V7.00 Angus added CliId property used to ensure correct client freed
                    (did not call it ID to avoid conflicts with existing clients)
Aug 8,  2010 V7.01 FPiette enhanced TriggerSessionAvailable so catch exception
                   in client class constructor and ClientCreate, and close the
                   remote socket in that case.
Feb 4,  2011 V7.02 Angus added bandwidth throttling using TCustomThrottledWSocket.
                   Client sockets inherit server settings for BandwidthLimit and
                   BandwidthSampling, but these can be changed ideally in
                   OnClientCreate event, but also in OnClientConnect but note a
                   timer may have been started by then so better to default to
                   BandwidthLimit=0 and set it, than to disable it.
Apr 15, 2011 V7.03 Arno prepared for 64-bit.
May 13, 2011 V7.04 Anton S. found a small issue with CliId.
May 2012 - V8.00 - Arno added FireMonkey cross platform support with POSIX/MacOS
                   also IPv6 support, include files now in sub-directory
Jul 21, 2012 V8.01 Fix in TCustomMultiListenWSocketServer.TriggerClientConnect.
Jun 03, 2013 V8.02 FPiette added unit "Types" so that some inlines are
                   expanded.
Jun 09, 2013 V8.03 FPiette WMClientClosed clear CliId before freeing.
Aug 18, 2013 V8.04 Arno - It was not possible to clear both string properties
                   Banner and BannerTooBusy in OI since empty strings were not
                   stored in the .dfm.
Aug 18, 2013 V8.05 Arno added some default property specifiers.
Mar 10, 2015 V8.06 Angus CloseDelayed when too many clients so closes cleanly
Mar 23, 2015 V8.07 Angus onSslServerName and OnBgException events set for clients
Oct 26, 2016 V8.36 Angus TWSocketMultiListenItem now has SslEnable moved from SSL class
                   Added extended exception information
Nov 9,  2016  V8.37 Client inherits server SocketErrs
Apr 11, 2017  V8.45 Added multiple SSL host support to TSslWSocketServer.
                    There is a new IcsHosts property which allows multiple hosts
                      to be specified, each with one or two IP addresses and
                      non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
                      key, SSL context and security level, and other web server
                      host related properties (not used here).
                    If IcsHosts is specified, TSslWSocketServer ignores existing
                      bindings and SSLContext, and creates new bindings and
                      initialises an SSL context for each host checking and
                      reporting all server certificate chains.
                    IcsHosts includes SslSrvSecurity SSL server security
                       level, that sets protocol, cipher and SslSecLevel according
                       to eight levels from sslSrvSecNone to sslSrvSecHigh192 to
                       avoid needing to set protocols and ciphers in SSL context.
                    IcsHosts includes SslCert, SslKey, SslPassword and SslInter.
                      SslCert may be a file name or a ASCII PEM string containing
                      an Ssl server certificate. The file may be PEM/CER/DER/PFX/P12/etc,
                      either a single certificate or bundle with private key and
                      any intermediates (PEM/PFX/P12 only), SslPassword is the private
                      key password if encrypted.  If a bundle is not found, SslKey is
                      a PEM file or ASCII PEM private key, and SslInters is any
                      intermediate SSL certificates used to sign the server SSL cert
                      as a file name in PEM/CER/DER format or ASCII PEM.
                    TSslWSocketServer has new RootCA property which should be loaded
                      with CA Root certificates to validates the server chain and
                      new DHParams property for a context DHParams file or string.
                    The ValidateHosts property checks all host properties and
                      attempts to validate SSL certificate chains and hosts,
                      it keeps certificate chain information in the IcsHosts CertInfo
                      property and validation warnings or error in ErrInfo.
                    TWSocketClient includes new properties IcsHostIdx, MultiListenIdx
                      and HostTag to identify which IcsHost and MultiListen socket
                      accepted the connection.  Published client server and remote peer
                      address and port as CServerAddr, CServerPort, CPeerAddr and
                      CPeerPort since many clients need this information.
Apr 20, 2017  V8.46 New RootCA property is now a String (filename or base84 string)
                    Improved IcsHost.GetDisplayName a little
                    Set IcsLogger for SSL context
May 16, 2017  V8.47 IcsHosts keeps file time stamps of SSL certs to check if
                      changed, and BindInfo with reportable bindings.
                    Added IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni function which loads IcsHosts from
                      an open INI file to simplify application creation.
                    Fixed IcsLogger conditional.
May 24, 2017  V8.48 ValidateHosts has options to return all errors as a string
                      instead of raising an exception on the first error.  The idea
                      is that some hosts may still work, even if one or more SSL
                      certificates are bad.
                    Added RecheckSslCerts which shoulld be called at least once a
                      day (after midnight) to check if new SSL certificates are
                      available and if old ones have expired.
                    Added ListenAllOK which returns true if all sockets are listening
                      OK, note starting a multilistener server does not give errors
                      if some listeners fail due to port conflicts.
                    Added ListenStates which returns a multiline string listing the
                       IP, port, SSL and state of all socket listeners.
                    Updated Added IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni to add web server properties.
June 23, 2017 V8.49 Fixes so we support MacOS again, thanks to Michael Berg.
                    Added more elements to IcsHosts for a .well-known path and
                      web redirection.
                    Added MultiListenEx which opens all possible sockets ignoring
                      errors, which are returned as a string.
Aug 10, 2017  V8.50 Minor clean up
Nov 22, 2017  V8.51 SSL certificate file stamp now stored as UTC date to avoid
                       summer time triggers as file system stamps change
Feb 14, 2018  V8.52 Better error reporting when validating SSL certificates
                    Add TLSv3 ciphers for OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later only
Jun 12, 2018  V8.55 sslSrvSecInter/FS now requires TLS1.1, PCI council EOF TLS1.0 30 June 2018
Jul 6, 2018   V8.56 Added OnSslAlpnSelect called after OnSslServerName for HTTP/2.
Oct 5, 2018  V8.57  Fixed bug so that a newly found SSL certificate is immediately
                      loaded to the context.
                    IcsHosts INI file now accepts enum string for SslSecLevel, ie
                       SslSecLevel=sslSrvSecHigh as well as sslSrvSecHigh=5 .
                    IcsHosts INI file prefers new HostEnabled to older Enabled,
                       avoids confusion with other Enabled properties.
                    Added SslCliCertMethod to allow server to request a client
                       SSL certificate from the browser, NOTE you should check it
                       the OnSslHandshakeDone event and close the connection if
                       invalid, beware this usually causes the browser to request
                       a certificate which can be obtrusive.
                    Allow SSL certificates to be ordered and installed automatically
                       by RecheckSslCerts if SslCertAutoOrder=True and so specified in
                       IcsHosts, if a TSslX509Certs component is attached and a
                       certificate supplier account has been created (by the
                       OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst sample application).
                    Added LoadOneCert which consolidates all certificate loading code
                       from ValidateHosts and RecheckSslCerts.
Oct 19, 2018  V8.58 Increased ListenBacklog property default to 15 to handle
                      higher server loads before rejecting new connections.
                    Documentation on IcsHosts and main components.   


Quick reference guide:
----------------------

TWSocketServer will normally be used to listen on a given tcp port. When a
client connect, it will instanciate a new TWSocketClient component to handle
communication with client. Normally you will derive your own component from
TWSocketClient to add private data and methods to handle it. You tell
TWSocketServer which component it has to instantiate using ClientClass
property. You have to initialize instances from OnClientConnect event handler.
TWSocketServer maintain a list of connected clients. You can access it using
Client[] indexed property and ClientCount property.


IcsHosts
--------

When originally designed TWSocketServer only supported listening on a single IP
address and port, subsequently MultiListenSockets were added to listen on multiple
IP addresses and ports, and TSslWSocketServer SSL support required a lot of extra
code in the application to specify SSL certificates, protocols, ciphers and
security using multiple SslContexts for multiple hosts.

The IcsHosts property is an alternate way for specifying multiple listeners for
TSslWSocketServer that allows multiple hosts to be specified, each with one or
two IP addresses and non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
key (perhaps combined in a bundle), SSL context and security level, and other web
server host related properties (used by higher level components).  Each IcsHost
has one or more HostNames to which it will recognise, that can share IP addresses.

If IcsHosts is specified, TSslWSocketServer ignores existing bindings and SSL
context, and creates new bindings and initializes an SSL context for each host
checking and reporting all server certificate chains.  To ease implementation,
functions are provided to read IcsHosts and TWSocketServer from an INI file, or
they may be specified through IDE form properties and saved by other means.

Note IcsHosts is only available for TSslWSocketServer, not TWSocketServer, but
you don't need to use SSL for any Hosts.

HostNames     - One or more domain Host Names to which the server will respond,
                comma separated list, no quotes.  Host Names are matched initially
                against SSL Server Name Indication (SNI), or against the HTTP
                Host: header if no SSL or SNI for web and proxy servers. Note
                INI file reads as Hosts.  Wild card host names are not allowed,
                but SNI may match a wild card certificate to an IcsHost.
HostEnabled   - True or False if this IcsHost is enabled, NOTE INI file also
                reads Enabled if HostEnabled missing for backward compatibility.
BindIpAddr    - Listening IP Address for this IcsHost, may be 0.0.0.0 for all IP
                Addresses, must exist.  Multiple IcsHosts can use the same IP
                Address which will then be chosen from HostNames using SNI or
                Host: header.
BindIpAddr2   - Optional second IP Address for this IcsHost, perhaps an IPv6
                address.
BindNonPort   - Optional non-SSL/TLS Port, may be blank or zero if only SSL is
                supported by IcsHost, usually 80 for HTTP, required if
                WellKnownPath specified for SSL automatic certificates.
BindSslPort   - Optional SSL/TLS Port, may be blank or zero if SSL not supported
                by IcsHost, if used generally 443 for HTTPS, and several other SSL
                parameters are required.  Either BindNonPort or BindSslPort is
                required.
HostTag       - A short alphabetic name for the IcsHost, used variously in
                high level servers.  The web application server uses HostTag in
                the AddGetHandler, AddPostHandler and AddGetAllowedPath to cause
                that handler to be matched.  The proxy server uses HostTag to
                match source to one or more targets.  When SocketServer creates
                a TWSocketClient for a new connection it sets the IcsHostIdx and
                HostTag properties to this value, also ServerAddr and ServerPort
                for the bindings.
Descr         - Optional free description of the IcsHost, may be used for logging.
Proto         - Optional high level protocol used by this IcsHost, used variously
                in servers.  The proxy server uses HTTP, SMTP, POP3, etc.
ForwardProxy  - Optional True/False used by the proxy server if this IcsHost is
                functioning as a Forward Proxy rather than a Reverse Proxy. A
                forward supports multiple targets according to the URL, while a
                reverse proxy generally ignores the URL and has a single fixed
                target, sometimes multiple fixed targets depending on the URL.
                See OverbyteIcsProxy.pas for more information.
WebDocDir     - Optional default web document directory for this IcsHost, used by
                the web server.
WebTemplDir   - Optional default web template directory for this IcsHost, used by
                the web server.
WebDefDoc     - Optional default web document for this IcsHost, used by the web
                server.
WebLogDir     - Optional web logging directory for this IcsHost, for use by web
                server applications (not by the server itself which has not
                logging).
SslCert       - Optional SSL server certificate file name, may be PEM, DER, PFX,
                P12, P7 format, optionally a bundle including a private key and
                one or more intermediate certificates.  Required if BindSslPort
                set. If a private key is included, will use SslPassword for an
                encrypted file. Rather than a file name, may be an ASCII PEM string
                containing the certificate without any line endings.  HostNames
                will be checked against those listed on the certificate, and a not
                warning given for mismatches so a single certificate needs to
                contain all the HostName, or wild cards * so they match.
                TSslWSocketServer has a method RecheckSslCerts that should be
                called from the server application periodically, at least once
                a day, which will check the certificate file time stamp and
                reload it if changed, issue warnings if it expires within
                CertExpireDays (default 30) and optionally order a new
                certificate, see CertSupplierProto below.  Note if automatic
                certificate ordering is used, the file name in SslCert must
                conform to the format used by the TSslX509Certs component, with
                the host name having all dots replaced by underscore and * by x,
                then with suffix .pfx or -bundle.pem, ie
                test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem or
                test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx.
SslKey        - Optional SSL private key file name, PEM format, will use
                SslPassword for an encrypted file.  Ignored if SslCert was a
                bundle file with a private key.  Note all SSL servers need an
                SSL certificate and matching private key to function, and these
                are checked before the server will start. Rather than a file
                name, may be an ASCII PEM string containing the private key
                without any line endings.
SslInter      - Optional SSL intermediate certificate bundle file name, PEM, DER,
                P12 or P7 format. Ignored if SslCert was a bundle with
                intermediate certificates.  The SSL certificate chains is checked
                to ensure the server certificate is signed by an intermediate or
                trusted root certificate, and likewise the intermediate(s). The
                TSslWSocketServer RootCA property specifies a PEM bundle file
                containing the trusted root certificates, if not specified an
                internal bundle of about 36 major root certificates is used.
SslPassword   - Optional password for the SSL private key, if encrypted.  Note
                this is clear text in the INI file, steps should be taken to read
                an encrypted password if security is required.  Beware most
                PFX/P12 bundles need a password, since Windows will not import
                them without a password.
SslSrvSecurity - Optional SSL server security level, that sets protocol, cipher
                and SslSecLevel according to eight levels from type TSslSrvSecurity:
                sslSrvSecNone, sslSrvSecSsl3, sslSrvSecBack, sslSrvSecInter,
                sslSrvSecInterFS, sslSrvSecHigh, sslSrvSecHigh128, sslSrvSecHigh192.
                Details of each are in the OverbyteIcsSSLEAY.pas unit.  Beware the
                server may not start, ie High128 requires an RSA private key length
                greater than the 2,048 bits commonly used.  If not specified,
                sslSrvSecDefault is used which is currently sslSrvSecInterFS
                meaning TLSv1.1 or later with forward security ciphers.
WellKnownPath - Optional, full file directory path for .Well-Known web URLs, used
                by the web and proxy servers for automated SSL certificates.
WebRedirectURL - Optional, a web server redirection URL, used in the proxy server
                to redirect HTTP connections to HTTPS, if WebRedirectStat is none
                zero.  Not currently used by the web server, but web server
                applications can add event code to use these values, see event
                SslHttpAppSrv1GetDocument in OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas.
                Or more intelligent redirection could be implemented like
                changing http:// to https://.
WebRedirectStat - Optional, a web server redirection status code, 301, 302, 307
                or 308 depending on reason.
CertSupplierProto - Optional, if SSL X509 certificates are to be automatically
                ordered, downloaded and installed, specifies the Supplier and
                Protocol to be used as type TSupplierProto. Currently supports
                SuppProtoNone, SuppProtoAcmeV2 and SuppProtoCertCentre. Ignored
                unless TSslWSocketServer property SslCertAutoOrder is True.
                Note any SSL certificates ordered will use all HostNames so must
                support multiple Subject Alternative Names if more than one host
                is specified.  Note wild card certificates can not currently be
                ordered by IcsHosts, but can be done using TSslX509Certs.
                Automatic certificate ordering is triggered by calling the server
                method RecheckSslCerts after the server has started listening,
                which checks all certificates and chains for expiry within
                CertExpireDays (default 30) and will then order a new certificate
                for any that fail, including certificate file missing.  The server
                application should call RecheckSslCerts at least once a day, but
                it can be more often to give more chances to check for ordering
                problems.  The TSslX509Certs has an internal timer that checks
                for order completion and calls an onNewCert event when the new
                certificate is ready, this event should call RecheckSslCerts again
                which will find the new certificate file and load it into
                SslContext.
CertDirWork   - Optional, if CertSupplierProto is not SuppProtoNone, specifies
                the Certificate Database Working Directory, in which an account
                that matches CertSupplierProto should already have been created,
                see OverbyteIcsSslX509Certs.pas for more information.  All new
                certificates, requests and private keys are saved in the work
                directory with a unique order number, then again with the final
                name format, and finally the certificate bundles as PEM and PFX
                are copied to the directory used by SslCert.  CertDirWork must
                not be the same directory as SslCert.  Generally, CertDirWork
                should be the same for all Hosts that order certificates for the
                server, because the TSslX509Certs currently only checks for
                completed order for one supplier database at a time.  Different
                directories can be used, provided certificates do not expire the
                same day.
CertChallenge - Optional, if CertSupplierProto is not SuppProtoNone, specifies
                the Challenge Type as TChallengeType, used by the supplier to
                check the domain names for the certificate resolve to this server.
                Currently supports ChallNone, ChallFileUNC, ChallDNS and
                ChallEmail.  Note that DNS require extra code in the server
                application to update DNS records. ChallFileUNC means the server
                will create a special file in the .Well-Known directory which
                the supplier will read for each different HostName to confirm
                they can all be accessed from the public internet, this usually
                happens within a few seconds for domain validated certificates.
                ChallEmail means that manual validation of the host names will
                be needed, with notification by email when ready, but the
                component will periodically check with the supplier to see when
                the order is completed and can be downloaded and installed.
CertProduct   - Optional, primarily for CertSupplierProto is SuppProtoCertCentre
                to specify the particular certificate issuer and product,
                currently only AlwaysOnSSL.AlwaysOnSSL supported since all
                commercial certificates require contact details not in these
                properties.  For SuppProtoAcmeV2, use Let's Encrypt currently
                for descriptive purposes although in theory other suppliers may
                use the same Acme2 protocol for other certificates.
CertPKeyType  - Optional, specifies the new SSL certificate Private Key algorithm
                and key length as type TSslPrivKeyType. Typically use
                PrivKeyRsa2048, PrivKeyRsa3072, PrivKeyRsa4096, PrivKeyECsecp256,
                PrivKeyECsecp384, PrivKeyECsecp512 or PrivKeyEd25519, although
                the supplier may reject any of them. Beware RSA keys longer than
                4,096 bits can take many minute to generate blocking the server.
CertSignDigest - Optional, specifies the new SSL certificate request signing
                digest as type TEvpDigest.  Typically use Digest_sha256,
                Digest_sha384 or Digest_sha512, there are now SHA3 options but
                unlikely to be supported by suppliers yet.

Once IcsHosts have been validated, a number of read only properties are available
with more information about the IcsHost from the certificate and bindings, that
may be usefully logged for configuration and error checking purposes.

SslCtx       - TSslContext component used by IcsHost.
HostNameTot  - Number of items in HostNames TStrings.
DisplayName  - IcsHost display name, variously using HostTag, Descr, and bind
               IP addresses and ports.
CertDomains  - Comma separated list of SSL certificate host names from Subject
               Alternate Names field.
CertInfo     - A long multiple line text block describing all the main fields of
               one or more SSL certificates in the chain including subject,
               issuer, expiry, public key type and signature method.
BindInfo     - List of one or more IP addresses and ports.
CertExiry    - SSL certificate expiry date and time, as TDateTime.
CertFStamp   - Unix file time stamp for SSL server certificate, to check if
               changed.
InterFStamp  - Unix file time stamp for SSL intermediate certificates, to check
               if changed.
CertErrs     - Description of any errors found in the SSL certificate chain
               during validation.
CertValRes   - SSL certificate chain validation result as type TChainResult,
               chainOK, chainFail, chainWarn, chainNone.
BindIdxNone  - MultiListenIdx for first IP address, non-SSL.
BindIdxSsl   - MultiListenIdx for first IP address, SSL.
BindIdx2None - MultiListenIdx for second IP address, non-SSL.
BindIdx2Ssl  - MultiListenIdx for second IP address, SSL.


0Auth2 Consideration
--------------------

If the CertSupplierProto requirss 0Auth2 authentication, ie SuppProtoCertCentre,
a TSslX509Certs event is triggered with a browser URL that should be visited to
login to the supplier account.  For a background server, the application can
send an email to an administrator who performs the login manually on the same
PC as the server is running, and the TSslX509Certs component will accept and
save the authentication token automatically and use it for the next certificate
order attempt. Tokens usually expire after 12 to 24 hours, but the server will
automatically refresh the token provided it is not stopped before token expiry.


TSslWSocketServer
-----------------

Proto        - Server protocol, always TCP.
Addr         - Server listen IP address, IPv4 or IPv6, maybe 0.0.0.0 or :: to
               listen on all available addresses, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified.  IP address must exist and not be in use elsewhere
               for the same port.
Port         - Server listen port, usually 80 or 443, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified.
SocketFamily - IP address socket family as TSocketFamily, from sfIPv4, sfIPv6.
SslEnable    - True if an SSL connection should be negotiated. ignored if any
               IcsHosts specified.
SslContext   - Assign to an TSslContext component for SSL support, where SSL
               certificates, keys, protocols and ciphers are specified, ignored
               if any IcsHosts specified.
MultiListenSockets - Allows one or more extra server listen IP addresses and
               ports to be specified, as type TWSocketMultiListenCollection,
               allowing server to listen on several IP addresses/ports at the
               same time, in addition to the that specified as Addr/Port props.
               Each TWSocketMultiListenItem has Addr, Port, SocketFamily,
               SslEnable and ListenBacklog properties. Better to use IcsHosts
               for new applications which does the same, ignored if any IcsHosts
               specified.
MultiListenIndex - Read only, which listen socket accepted last connection, -1
               if default Addr.Poprt used, 0 or above is index into
               MultiListenSockets collection.
MaxClients   - Maximum number of simultaneous clients the server should accept
               if non-zero.  Any further clients will receive then BannerTooBusy
               response and the connection closed, until earlier connections
               are closed.
Banner       - If non-blank, a text string that will be sent in response to a
               new incoming connection, should generally be blank.
BannerTooBusy - If non-blank, a text string that will be sent once MaxClients
               is exceeded.
ClientClass  - The class type the application has derived from TSslWSocketClient
               for client application code.
Client       - Currently active clients of ClientClass, indexed base zero.  Note
               the index value may change each time a new client connects or
               disconnects, so check CliId to confirm it's the correct one.
ClientCount  - Number of active client connected.
SocketErrs   - How socket error messages should be presented as type TSocketErrs,
               wsErrTech or wsErrFriendly.
ExclusiveAddr - True is other applications should be blocked from sharing the
               server IP addresses.
ListenBacklog - How many new client connections should be queued by Windows while
               the server accepts them, before the server starts rejecting new
               connections by immediately closing them.  Recommended as 15 for
               heavy use servers, may be up to 250.
IcsHosts     - Allows one or more TIcsHosts to be set, as TIcsHostCollection, an
               alternate way for specifying multiple listeners that allows
               multiple hosts to be specified, each with one or two IP addresses
               and non-SSL and SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private
               key (perhaps combined in a bundle), SSL context and security level,
               and other web server host related properties (used by higher level
               components).  Each IcsHost has one or more HostNames to which it
               will recognise, that can share IP addresses.  See above for more
               detail.
RootCA       - Specifying a file name containing a PEM bundle of trusted root SSL
               certificates allows validation of SSL server certificate chains.
               ICS includes RootCaCertsBundle.pem (large) and TrustedCABundle.pem
               (medium size), and a default built-in (small) that will be used
               if no file is specified.
DHParams     - Specifies a DHParams file name, created using the PenTools sample,
               or use the provided dhparam1024.pem or dhparam2048.pem files. Used
               for DH and DHE ciphers, but not needed for modern ECDHE ciphers.
               Rather than a file name, may be an ASCII PEM string containing
               the DHParams without any line endings.
SslCliCertMethod - Allows server to request a client SSL certificate from the
               browser or remote application, as type TSslCliCertMethod, with
               sslCliCertNone, sslCliCertOptional or sslCliCertRequire. Require
               will close the connection unless a valid certificate is received
               and validated against RootCA. Beware requesting a client
               certificate usually causes the browser to prompt the user for
               which certificate to send which can be obtrusive.
CertExpireDays - When using IcsHosts, the number of days before an SSL server
               certificate is due to expire that warnings will be generated (by
               the method RecheckSslCerts, perhaps triggering automatic SSL
               certificate ordering.
SslCertAutoOrder - True if IcsHosts are allowed to order and install SSL
               certificates automatically.  Requires SslX509Certs property to
               be set, and CertSupplierProto set for any IcsHost that will order
               certificates.
SslX509Certs - Assign to a TSslX509Certs component if automatic SSL certificate
               ordering is required.  Ir ia very important that the onCertProg
               is used to log progress messages from the certificate ordering
               process in case of errors.  The onCertsChallengeDNS event is
               called if a DNS server should be updated, onCertsOAuthAuthUrl if
               0Auth2 authenication is needed, and onCertsNewCert when a new
               certificate is available which should be logged and the
               RecheckSslCerts method called to cause the server to load it.


TSslWSocketClient
-----------------

Each new incoming connection to TSslWSocketServer causes a new instance of
TSslWSocketClient to be created, with a number of read only properties set,
that may be useful for client application code.  Generally, applications will
create their own class descended from TSslWSocketClient which is where all
the code to listen to requests and send responses will go.

Server      - TCustomWSocketServer component to which the client belongs.
PeerAddr    - Remote IP address of the client, IPv4 or IPv6.
PeerPort    - Remote IP port of the client.
SessionClosedFlag - True if the client is in the process of closing.
CliId       - A sequential client ID number that may be used to identify the
              client, note clients are creating and destroyed regularly.
IcsHostIdx  - If 0 or higher index into the IcsHosts collection, -1 if
              IcsHosts not used.
MultiListenIdx - -1 if default SocketServer listener used, 0 or above is
              index into MultiListenSockets collection.
HostTag     - A short alphabetic name for the IcsHost, used variously in
              high level servers.
CServerAddr - Local server IP address for listener.
CServerPort - Local server IP port for listener.

Description:  A component adding SSL support to TWSocketServer.
              Requires OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org).
              More details in ReadMeIcsSsl.txt and IcsSslHowTo.txt.
              SSL demo applications can be found in /Delphi/SslInternet.
              If you use Delphi 7 and later, you may want to disable warnings
              for unsage type, unsafe code and unsafe typecast in the project
              options. Those warning are intended for .NET programs. You may
              also want to turn off deprecated symbol and platform symbol
              warnings.
